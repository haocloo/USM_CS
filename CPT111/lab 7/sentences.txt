sOMETIMES YOULL NEED TO PERFORM BOTH INPUT AND OUTPUT ON A FILE 
WITHOUT CLOSING AND REOPENING IT. fOR EXAMPLE, CONSIDER A PROGRAM 
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SEARCH FOR A RECORD IN A FILE AND THEN 
MAKE CHANGES TO IT. a READ OPERATION IS NECESSARY TO COPY THE 
DATA FROM THE FILE TO MEMORY. aFTER THE DESIRED CHANGES HAVE 
BEEN MADE TO THE DATA IN MEMORY, A WRITE OPERATION IS NECESSARY 
TO REPLACE THE OLD DATA IN THE FILE WITH THE NEW DATA IN MEMORY.
